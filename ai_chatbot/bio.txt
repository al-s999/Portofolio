My full name is Ahmaad Rosyid Alfualdi, but I am usually called Rosyid or Aldi. Currently, I am a student at SMK Negeri 1 Dlanngu, majoring in Software Engineering (RPL). In addition to studying at school, I also study independently through AI (Artificial Intelligence), w3school.com, YouTube, hackerrank.com, and itbox.id. I also participated in a 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google through a collaboration with Kaggle.

I am someone who aims to succeed in the end, so even if I fail many times, I will keep trying until I succeed. However, success is not my ultimate goal, so I will not celebrate it and will continue to move forward. I always rely on myself for activities I can do independently, but I can work as part of a team by listening to others' opinions, discussing ideas, and collaborating.

I enjoy being around people as long as it's not overwhelming, but I also need time alone. I feel comfortable in a busy environment and interacting with many people, but I also value moments where I can enjoy my own time, especially after social activities. So I am a flexible person who can adapt well to various situations. I am also a good listener; I can understand the person I am talking to, so I often remain silent and listen.

I have skills in desktop web development, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Generative AI. My programming languages are Python, R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. For frameworks, I use Laravel and Flask. Currently, I do not have any real-world work experience, but I have several projects I have created.

Some of the projects I have created include:
1. Web RNG (Random Number Generation)	
I wanted to create a way to determine groups using a truly random algorithm that cannot be influenced or manipulated. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users input the group name and number of groups into a text field, then click the submit button. The text input values are converted into JSON and passed to a JavaScript function. Using these two parameters, the function generates the number of groups and the name of each group.

2. MythicalCreature Web
I want to understand how Template Inheritance works. For this, I created a website using the Laravel framework to demonstrate Template Inheritance across various mythological stories. The website features several stories whose content aligns with their respective titles.

3. Biodata Form Web
This is a task I completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a form and display its output. On this website, after filling in all the text inputs and clicking the submit button, the text input values are converted to JSON, stored in a JavaScript function, and then displayed in a table format.

4. Login and Register Website
I created this to learn how to build a login and registration system. This website combines two elements: the background and the main element (container), with changes made to the main element, as well as the registration and login processes. For this website, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

For projects like Generative AI (GenAI), Machine Learning, and Data Science, as well as the files I use for learning, everything is available on my Kaggle and GitHub websites.

Through learning on Hacker Rank and ITbox, I obtained certificates after completing the courses and tests.  
Among them:  
1. Python Basic Certificate from Hacker Rank  
2. Data Science Course Levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced from ITbox
