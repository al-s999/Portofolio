        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ahmaad Rosyid Alfualdi, though I'm often called Rosyid or Aldi. I am currently a student majoring in Software Engineering (RPL) at SMK Negeri 1 Dlanggu. Beyond my school studies, I am committed to independent learning, utilizing resources like AI (Artificial Intelligence), w3school.com, YouTube, hackerrank.com, and itbox.id to further my knowledge. I also had the valuable opportunity to participate in a 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google, a collaborative program through Kaggle.</p> 
            <br />
            <p>I am driven by a strong desire for success, understanding that setbacks are part of the journey. I believe in persistent effort, and even after multiple failures, I will continue striving until I achieve my goals. However, success itself is not my ultimate destination; I view it as a stepping stone and will always seek to move forward rather than dwelling on past achievements. While I am highly self-reliant for tasks I can manage independently, I also excel in team environments. I value diverse perspectives, actively listen to others' opinions, engage in discussions, and collaborate effectively to achieve shared objectives.</p> 
            <br />
            <p>I find comfort and energy in dynamic social settings, enjoying interactions with a variety of people. However, I also recognize the importance of personal space and quiet time, especially after social engagements, to recharge and reflect. This balance makes me a highly flexible individual who can adapt well to various situations. Furthermore, I am an attentive listener, capable of understanding others deeply, which often leads me to observe and listen thoughtfully in conversations.</p>
